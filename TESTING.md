## Code Validation

### Python
 
I have used the [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all Python files.

There were no errors, apart from minor indentation and whitespace errors, all of which have been corrected. 

A sample test is shown here:

## Python Unit Testing

I conducted a series of automated tests on [posts/views.py](https://adamalive-sculpturedrfa-aw4zyb1un53.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net/) and acknowledge that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be required.

- Result: Pass, no errors:
