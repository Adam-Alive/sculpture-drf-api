# London Outdoor Sculpture API

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a photo-sharing website for images of outdoor sculpture across the Greater London area.

Once registered, users will be able to post images, like and comment upon posts, follow other users and sign-up for online talks.

The site administrator will be able to monitor and modify all aspects of the site including the deletion of posts, comments and users if necessary.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a front-end, built using React, and a back-end API database built with the Django Rest Framework.

This section covers the back-end API, while the React front-end and project overall are covered here: **[London Outdoor Sculpture README](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/london-outdoor-sculpture/blob/main/README.md)**

The back-end API is deployed here: **[sculpture-drf-api](https://sculpture-drf-api-2aa8ed66624d.herokuapp.com/)**

The front-end website is deployed here **[London Outdoor Sculpture](https://london-outdoor-sculpture-392a8873bf1b.herokuapp.com/)**
## User Stories

User stories are listed here: **[User Stories](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/london-outdoor-sculpture/blob/main/README.md#user-stories)**

## Database Design

### Models
The database is comprised of eight models, including Django's User model:
- User (Django)
- Booking
- Comment
- Follower
- Like
- Post
- Profile
- Talk

I then constructed an ERD for each model and show here the Talk and Booking models:

At project completion I used [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) to auto-generate ERDs for the final project:

(CODE FROM PROJECT 4 TO BE UPDATED)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User {
        int id
        string username
        string password
        string email
    }

    Booking {
        int id
        date date
        string sheet_time
        string wheelchair_sheet
    }
    Booking }o--|| User : "username"

    Faq {
        int id
        text question
        text answer
    }

    GalleryImage {
        int id
        string gallery_image
        string caption
        datetime added_on
        datetime caption_updated_on
        boolean approved
    }
    GalleryImage }o--|| User : "username (author)"

    Network {
        int id
        string club_name
        string location
        string website
        string email
        string wheelchair_access
    }
```



## Agile Project Management

For overall project management see: [London Outdoor Sculpture Agile Project Management](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/london-outdoor-sculpture/blob/main/README.md#agile-project-management)

### GitHub Projects and Issues

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/sculpture-drf-api/projects?query=is%3Aopen) served as an Agile tool for developing the backend API where epics and user stories were planned and then tracked on the Kanban board.

Using GitHub's projects and issues framework I created a GitHub project within the repository, and then developed issues within each:
- [API Sculpture User Stories](https://github.com/users/Adam-Alive/projects/12/views/1)

I created a **User Story Template** to manage user stories and provide here an example of a completed issue:

![Sample User Story](documentation/api-issue.png)

Progress on each user story was tracked on a weekly basis with overall project progress monitored on the milestones board, as shown below, where a list of closed and open milestones can be seen:

**Closed at the time of writing:**

![Milestones](documentation/api-ms.png)

**Open at the time of writing:**

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

**IMPORTANT:**

The live application is deployed on Heroku at: [Heroku]().

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a PostgreSQL database at [Code Institute]().

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online since Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

**IMPORTANT:**

This is a sample only - please replace the values with your own if cloning/forking this repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
    - `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
    - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

**IMPORTANT:**

This is a sample only - please replace the values with your own if cloning/forking this repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, follow these steps run it locally:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
